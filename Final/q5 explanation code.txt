#data section


".data" Section where data is stored in memory.
we use "digits:" what can be cosidered as a label or symbolic names for my data. 
".word 100"  Integers are referred to as words (32-bit value) we can get 3 digits.

.data
digits:	.word   100     # (one, ten, hundred) taking the 3 digits

Section that contains instructions and program logic

    .text
Declares an instruction label as global, making it accessible to other files
    .globl main

MIPS programs execute instructions sequentially, where the code under this label will be executed.
main:

we going to use $t = temporary register. can be used from $t0-$t10, to copy the word value from memory we getting 3 input from the user

    lw  $t9, digits    #load word to $t9, number of digist(3)

we use the method called polling checking the input device is ready. Receiver Control and Receiver Data

the memory layout where the register is going to be located, Receiver control 0xffff0000 and Receiver data 0xffff0004

    lui $t0, 0xffff      #load upper immediate
