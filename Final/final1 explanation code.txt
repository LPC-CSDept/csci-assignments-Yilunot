#data section


".data" Section where data is stored in memory.
we use "digits:" what can be cosidered as a label or symbolic names for my data. 
".word 100"  Integers are referred to as words (32-bit value) we can get 3 digits.

.data
digits:	.word   100     # (one, ten, hundred) taking the 3 digits

Section that contains instructions and program logic

    .text
Declares an instruction label as global, making it accessible to other files
    .globl main

MIPS programs execute instructions sequentially, where the code under this label will be executed.
main:

we going to use $t = temporary register. can be used from $t0-$t10, to copy the word value from memory we getting 3 input from the user

    lw  $2, digits    #load word to $2, number of digist(3)

we use the method called polling checking the input device is ready. Receiver Control and Receiver Data

the memory layout where the register is going to be located, Receiver control 0xffff0000 and Receiver data 0xffff0004

    lui $t0, 0xffff      #load upper immediate     

    we use a loop to wait for the input from the user. basically when there is a byte of data to ready.
    if the input control is not ready we have to be able to test it again 
waitloop:
   
   lw   $t1, 0($t0)            #load word from the input control register

until a character is typed at the keyboard, this will change the bit to 1 which meant that is ready.
form 0 to1 when a character is typed at the keyboard, from 1to 0 when the character is read from the receiver data registry

    andi $t1, $t1, 0x0001       #reset or clear all the bits except LSb
loop back to test for key input if it is 0 
    beq  $t1, $zero, waitloop   #if the bit is not ready yet go back to the waitloop
the character will be save in s0 
    lw   $s0, 4($t0)            #input device is ready so read a character from I/O

the calculation to convert the ascii value into decimal value
what ever digit the user enters, example if user press they key 4 is = 52-48 (0 in ascii key) = 4 
converts s0 ascii value to dec value
    sub	$s0, $s0, 48	# s0 = v0-48
This has one mul less per iteration, and there's no need of knowing the length of the digit before entering the loop.
    mul 	$s0, $s0, $2          # s0 = s0 * v0
dividing by ten to go to the next iteration of the user input
    div 	$2, $2, 10            	# t1 = t1/10
$s1 will contain 0 and will save the decimal value and add to the next position.
    add	$s1, $s1, $s0	# s1 = s1 + s0  
if the 2 user input isnt processed or null will go back to the loop to the next digit. 
    bnez $2, waitloop         	# brach on no equal to zero 


move value saved in $s1 to be printed to $a0 

    move	$a0, $s1	        # copy from register to register for print
    li      $v0, 1              # system call code for print integers.
    syscall 

the code for the program to end
    li      $v0,10              # code 10 == exit
    syscall                     # Return to OS.
